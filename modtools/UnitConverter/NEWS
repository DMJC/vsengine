      The textures used in the bfxm file will not yet be loaded (this is the next step).
    * Provides configurable units directory structure behavior:
      either traditional: 'units/Shipname' or
      progressive: 'units/vessels/Shipname'.
      As such it supports VS and Mods equally.

    * Fixed unwanted delete of file names on browse cancel.
    * Deleted the ini file from release. it will be created from scratch on first run,
      but you'll need to Config the app to work correctly (warning is shown).

      wiki (engine_*, turret_*, dock_*).
    * You may use substrings of turret types available in data/units/subunits
      directory for the subtype naming, e.g. turret_PminusBeam will create a
      turret of type turretLR_PminusBeam
    * Helper objects must be exported all together to a separate obj file.
    * The obj file must contain the word "marker", the sentence case is
      unimportant (so it can be e.g. "Markers"

      make use of it. 
    * Vector snap to cartesian axes is available in the vector class
