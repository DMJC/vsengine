VegaStrike for SGI 0.1.0 Beta
-----------------------------

Welcome to VegaStrike for SGI!

This version of VegaStrike has been tested successfully on an O2 and an
Octane, both running IRIX 6.5. There are still some quirks on the SGI
version not yet identified as bugs:

	* The shield seems to work (sometimes) but is not visible?
	* If destroyed, the ship still seems to be intact. After
	  some time, the cockpit controls disappear and you're
	  lost in space. Most controls are gone. Sometimes, views
	  can be changed (<F1> through <F6>), but then there are
	  situations where even those keys don't work anymore.
	  I suppose it has to do with the key press/release
	  state the program was in when the ship was destroyed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This are the major changes in the SGI version:

	* First, I couldn't get configure to work properly on my platform.
	  It does too much tests which just fail. I prefer the simple way
	  of doing things and have create an appropriate Makefile.irix.

	* The GLUT idle loop has been modified to not render the scene, but
	  rather initiate rendering by posting an event to GLUT which in
	  turn calls the main loop handler. The idle loop is also disabled
	  if the window isn't visible.

	* The Linux OpenGL extensions which are not available on the SGI
	  have been disabled. I'm sure that there is something similar
	  we could use instead, but for now I've just uncommented them
	  to get the whole thing running.

	* All changes are ifdef'ed(IRIX), except for fixes which caused
	  serious warnings or even errors with my MIPSPro 7.3 compiler.
