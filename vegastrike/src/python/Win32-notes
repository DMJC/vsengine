Potential pitfalls with Python on win32

MSVC 5,6 has a ridiculous bug that screws up Boost.python. If you get a
nonsensical error message talking about 'modulus' (something to do with
template name and formal parameter name conflicting, even though they're in
different namespaces and locals should mask those names), rename the formal
parameter to something else.  This may occur in other contexts.


You want to link with the debug libraries. If _DEBUG is defined, you have to:
You'll have to build the debug libraries manually

Sometimes, boost_python wants to load a different python library from your
code. This is VERY bad. Make sure that only one of Python22_d.dll and
Python22.dll is loaded.

#define BOOST_DEBUG_PYTHON from the Makefile for Vegastrike and Boost.Python to
force linking with the correct library

Also, make sure that the same version of msvcrt.dll is loaded for both boost.python
and Vegastrike. If compiling Vegastrike in debug, make sure that 

 /MDd 

is in STDOPTS in boost/libs/python/build/vc60.mak
If compiling in release, specify /MD
