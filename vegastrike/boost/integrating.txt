This file describes the integration process for adding new versions of the boost
python integrtion library to the Vega Strike build system.
Assuming that the version of boost works with Vega Strike, very little
developer time should be required.

1.  Create new directory under /boost of $VER, where $Ver has the . replaced with underscore.

2.  Add new dir to svn.   Run propedit svn:externals to point boost to desired release 
    For example,   boost http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/tags/release/Boost_1_35_0/boost
    commit. 

3.  svn copy src dir from last /boost/$VER to new /boost/$VER
    Use remote urls. 


4.  Modify m4scripts/VS_WITH_BOOST.m4
    a)  Modify the help string to show the new version.
    b)  Modify the case to treat the new version as valid
    c)  Copy one of the existing AM_CONDITIONAL lines and modify the
        version number to the version being added.
    d)  Optional:  Once the version is verified as working, modify the
        empty string case to set the version to the version being added.
    e)  Optional:  Delete references to obsolete versions of boost from
        the m4scripts/VS_WITH_BOOST.m4 file and remove the directory
        containing the obsolete version.
        useful commands:  
        
5.  Test new boost sources.
    a)  in vegastrike root directory, run autotools.
        (./bootstrap-sh --with-boost=${DOTTEDVER})
    b)  correct any errors seen in a) and repeat as necessary.
    c)  run make
    d)  correct any errors seen in c) and repeat as necessary.
