 *** IMPORTANT *** 

This is a development version of GLib.  You should be using a stable
version, which is available at ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.2/.  This
version is meant for developers of GLib only:

 * You should not base stable software on this version of GLib.
 * GNOME developers should use a stable version of GLib.

Distributions should *NOT* ship a development package of this GLib.
Do not ship the headers and do not ship the glib-config script.  These
things will conflict with the stable 1.2 series.  Package only enough
to satisfy the requirements of some other package.  Package only the
library itself.  Doing otherwise will do no favors to the community.

If you install this version of GLib, we strongly recommend that you
install it in a different prefix than GLib 1.2.  Use --prefix as an
argument to configure to do this.  Otherwise, you will not be able to
do development with GLib 1.2 any longer.

*** You should be using GLib 1.2 instead. ***

How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, send mail either to gtk-list, as mentioned
above, or to gtk-bugs@gtk.org. If you send mail to gtk-list, you
must be subscribed yourself.

In the mail include:

* The version of GLib

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testglib program that is built 
  in the glib/ directory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches can be uploaded to the incoming/ directory on
ftp.gtk.org.  Please follow the instructions there, and include
your name and email address in the README file.

If the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include
all the information described in "How to Report Bugs".
