15th Dec 2010:

Current solution(s) Will build working binaries.
Solutions may change again in the new further to split vegaserver into its own solution. This is not certain though.
New icons needed for mesher, basemaker, and mission selector. If you would like to contribute send me a PM on the forums @ pheonixstorm 

Express users, if you have any issues please use the VCExpress.diff to update your resource (.rc) files for the project causing problems. Also, you will need to use the 2008 SDK or higher.

If you use a version of Visual C++ higher than the current solution/project submit your current versions project/solution files to the forums for inclusion here.
